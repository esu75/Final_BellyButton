# Java_Script_BellyButton_Biodiversity_Dashboard

In this project, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions
Complete the following steps:
1.	Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from [this external link](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json)
   
2.	Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
	
   i. Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
  	
  ii. Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
  
 iii. Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
 
### Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

•	Use otu_ids for the x values.

•	Use sample_values for the y values.

•	Use sample_values for the marker size.

•	Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

•	Use otu_labels for the text values.

•	Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

•	Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard is shown as follows:

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file
